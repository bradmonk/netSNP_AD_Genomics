## Abstract

There is hope that genomic information will improve complex disease prediction and treatment, and elucidate
pathophysiology. Here, using exome data sets from ~10,000 individuals, we explore machine learning neural
network (NN) methods to estimate the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on Alzheimer's Disease
(AD) risk. We develop a NN-based method (netSNP) that identifies sets with hundreds of novel “protective” or
“at-risk” AD-associated SNPs, the majority with frequency under 0.01. For case individuals, the number of
“protective” (or “at-risk”) netSNP-identified SNPs in their genome correlates positively (or inversely) with their
age of AD diagnosis and inversely (or positively) with autopsy neuropathology. Simulations argue against our
results being due to genetic linkage, overfitting or potential bias introduced by netSNP. These findings indicate
netSNP can identify SNPs associated with AD pathophysiology that may assist with diagnosis and mechanistic
understanding of the disease.
